This is my study from "Write yourself a Scheme in 48 hours".

This is my journey into the Scheme and Haskell.
It was difficult for me, because i have using C++ at most time.
But I enjoyed the programming of their languages, it is very fun.
Thanks to Jonathan Tang and the contributors of the wikibooks.
